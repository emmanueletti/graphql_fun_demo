Learning graphql in rails using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSlJH3hrV58)

project folder structure is a frankenstein mess from trying to follow tutorial using
Rails 7 instead of the videos version. Used GraphQl GUI application to interact with
the endpoint rather than the graphql-rails gem.
